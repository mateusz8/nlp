Today or tomorrow
On a claret paper clean and smug,
I have to get it done
With your sucker's mug.

What a filthy trade it is to paint.
What a filthy, filthy trade,
To limn each puss with no complaint,
And only to be poorly paid.

It's no great fun, I say,
To paint a janitor all day,
And for some bread
Explore the stupid head
