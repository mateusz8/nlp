t≈Çum. Jarek Zawadzki



The world adheres to vanity,
And craves all earthly property.
No centuries will ever tame,
Vanity's most meager fame.
Let's love and joke, lets joke and love,
But always mind the Heavens above,
Full piously and honestly.
All that is pure take properly.
But first of all do fear God's might!
A trifle then both death and fright.
