A Sonnet (One Heart)
tłum. Jarek Zawadzki



One heart, one heart is all I'm dreaming of
One heart upon this sullen earth I seek.
A heart to tremble with my heart in love,
So that I be a meek one mid the meek.

One pair of lips, wherefrom my lips for aye
Would drink the drink of joy with no constraints.
Two eyes that I could marvel at each day,
And see myself a saint among the saints.

One heart I need, two hands both soft and white
To veil my eyes and gently bar the light,
So I may fall asleep and by a touch

Of an angel’s cheek be carried to the sky.
One heart, one heart, so little though need I,
I see and know that I demand too much.
