Welcome My Beloved Mountains
tłum. Jarek Zawadzki



Welcome my beloved mountains,
Welcome O my river dear!
I used to be so far away,
But now again I am so near.

Crowds of people stood between us,
And the hubbub of the street;
And the patience farcical
That oft in sacrifice we meet.

Those are all remote domains,
Wilderness, and sterile waste;
Ruptured only by the longings
That my soul to you still haste.

My grief has brought me back to you,
So I am standing by your side,
O mountains, and I'm listening to
The waters' murmur deep and wide.

Yes! I am hiking, looking, listening…
How beautifully is all arranged!
And I am seeking to find out
If anything, since then, has changed.

Nothing, only in a roadside cabin
A friend of mine has died of age,
Withered are the willows two
That used to guard the springtide's stage.

Upon our olden ash-trees though
New leaves again have densely grown,
Yellow buttercups are shining
Among the greening grass unmown.

And from the fields I feel now blowing
Eternity's creative breeze
That into life transforms all death,
And puts my thoughts again at ease.

Welcome my beloved mountains,
Welcome O my river dear!
I used to be so far away,
But now again I am so near.
