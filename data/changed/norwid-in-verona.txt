Cyprian Kamil Norwid

In Verona
tłum. Jarek Zawadzki





1

O'er the abodes o'the Capulets and Montagues,
The gentle eye there in the spacious skies now views,
By thunder whipped and washed with rain — —



2

The lonesome ruins of the two adverse estates,
The once so splendid, now demolished, garden gates;
And casts a star from the heavenly plain —



3

The cypress says: For Romeo and Juliet
It is a tear that permeates their tombs so wet,
And drenches them — now even more.



4

But many people, in a sagely fashion, say
That it is rocks and stones not tears that fall today,
Stones and rocks — that none's been waiting for!
