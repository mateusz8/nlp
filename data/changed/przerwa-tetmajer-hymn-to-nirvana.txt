Hymn to Nirvana
t≈Çum. Jarek Zawadzki



Down from the depths of woe and pain to Thee I cry,
Nirvana!
Thy kingdom come on Earth and so in Heaven high,
Nirvana!
Snatch me now from evil's claws, for my arms are sore,
Nirvana!
And in the yoke that bleeds the neck let me walk no more,
Nirvana!
My eyes are splashed with human baseness' excrement,
Nirvana!
My foot is sliding in the people's mad intent,
Nirvana!
Abomination strangles me, disgust insane,
Nirvana!
My soul is wallowing in pain, convulsive pain,
Nirvana!
O come and may Thy hands upon my eyelids rest,
Nirvana!
May thy annihilating breath satiate my breast,
Nirvana!
My past and future life let me remember not,
Nirvana!
Detach my soul from all my memory and thought,
Nirvana!
And drive away from me the faces mean and foul,
Nirvana!
Destroy the altars and the man-made gods that prowl,
Nirvana!
Strong men's lives and weaklings' deaths: may these oppressions cease,
Nirvana!
And May the vacant stares of desperation vanish please,
Nirvana!
Let the depths of woe and pain upon my bosom die,
Nirvana!
Thy kingdom come on Earth and so in Heaven high,
Nirvana!
