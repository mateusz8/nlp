God's Plaything Man
t≈Çum. Jarek Zawadzki



No truer words were ever spoken than
A plaything of our Lord to call a man.
For is there anything a man has tried
That God's in no position to deride?
He's seen no God, but still he is so proud
That a god-like one he calls himself aloud.
His senses all with selfish love gone blind,
He thinks the world for him alone designed.
He'd been before he was; when he's not there,
He shall remain. Oh, fools are everywhere.
